# Old Interview Challenges
I will be posting materials from old interviews where I was asked to do work. My goals are to:

* demonstrate the skills I have
* show that I am still "working" even while interviewing by making edits to old work I submitted
* bring increased transparency to these processes

Here's a list of the contents of this repo so far:

* [Airkit CXE Interview](https://github.com/traintestbritt/2020_interview_challenges/blob/master/airkit_cxe_interview/README.md)
