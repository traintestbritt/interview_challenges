# 2020 Interview Challenges
I will be posting all of the materials from every interview I do where I am asked to do work. My goals in sharing my work are to:

* show that I am still "working" while interviewing
* bring increased transparency to interviewing processes

Here's a list of the contents of this repo so far:
