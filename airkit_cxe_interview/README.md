# Airkit Customer Experience Engineer Interview Materials

These are the materials I put to get for my 2nd round of interviewing with Airkit. I was simply asked to...

> Prepare a 10-15 minute presentation on a technical topic of your choice. This can be a specific technology, technical tool youâ€™ve used (IDE, debuggers, git, etc.), etc. You can create any content that is helpful to explain your topic, but what format that content takes is up to you.
Before your interview: Please send me the topic you plan on covering before the interview so I can let Zack & Nathan know. 


The topic I chose was REST APIS. For this presentation, I developed:

* [a video demo with subtitles](https://youtu.be/-Xf1Bukmy7g)
* [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ztFGIsIu_9US_ow_BGtE5M51Sjs1T0OSXHxWjFUhCo/edit?usp=sharing)
* [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yZKGFwzmv2eTpnZ39RDN5Q-q5xlXvNJIVElo2AuUBls/edit?usp=sharing)

Below are screenshots of each in the order they're listed above, but you can click the links to see the full extent of content I developed.

My goal with sharing this is to demonstrate the skills I have, show that I am still "working" while interviewing, and bring increased transparency to interviewing processes. Cheers!
